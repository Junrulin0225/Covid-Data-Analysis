#### Introduction
Welcome to the **Covid-19 Data Analysis Project (guided by Coursera)**ðŸ˜·!


ðŸ¦  In this project we worked with Covid-19 dataset, published by John Hopkins University, which consist of the data related to cumulative number of confirmed cases, per day, in each Country. 


ðŸ˜€ Another dataset that consists various life factors, scored by the people living in each country around the globe.  

We merged these two datasets to see if there is any relationship between the spread of the the virus in a country and how happy people are, living in that country.
